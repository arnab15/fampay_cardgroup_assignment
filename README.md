Some Bugs üêõ

-   I tried to make width of card as per screen width but It didn't work I spent couple of hours to fix this issue but unable to fix it ,lookin forward to take help from Fampay team so that I'll be able to fix the bug.
-   As I did not find any gradient color schema I was not able to intregate it although I made it flexible so that gradient can be added anytime

Although there is some bugs still Hope My assignment will be upto the mark so that i'll get a chance for next round, I'll try my best to fix remaining bugs.
